# FizzBuzz
## What is this project?
This project will start printing numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is divided by 3, then it will print the word "Fizz" instead. If the number is divided by 5, then it will print the word "Buzz" instead. If the number is divided by both 3 and 5, then the word "FizzBuzz" would be printed to the console.
